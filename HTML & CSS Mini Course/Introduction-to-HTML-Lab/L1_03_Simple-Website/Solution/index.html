            <p>This is my second blog entry, and I just wanted to check in on you. I published my first article
                    about
                    business blogging in August,<br>
                    2001. You can read it here. Whew. A lot of water under the bridge since then, including 9/11, which
                    happened only a few weeks <br> later.
                </p>

            <p>I'm so happy to write my first blog entry - yay! I published my first article about business blogging
                in
                August, 2001. You can read it <br>
                here. Whew. A lot of water under the bridge since then, including 9/11, which happened only a few
                weeks
                later.</p>
