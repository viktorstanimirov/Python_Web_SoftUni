            <h3>Just Another Day</h3>
            <p>Written by Christina on January 11th</p>
            <p>This is my second blog entry, and I just wanted to check in on you. I published my first article about
                business blogging in August,<br>
                2001. You can read it here. Whew. A lot of water under the bridge since then, including 9/11, which
                happened only a few weeks <br> later.
